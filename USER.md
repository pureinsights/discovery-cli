### Discovery

`discovery` is the Discovery CLI's root command. This is the command used to run the CLI. It contains all of the other subcommands.

Usage: `discovery [command]`

Flags:
`-h, --help`::
(Optional, bool) Prints the usage of the command.

`-p, --profile`::
(Optional, string) Set the configuration profile that will execute the command.

Examples:

```bash
# Print Discovery's help
discovery -h
```

#### Config
`config` is the main command used to interact with Discovery's configuration for a profile. This command by itself asks the user to save Discovery's configuration for the given profile. The command prints the property to be modified along with its current value. If the property currently being shown is sensitive, its value is obfuscated. To keep the current value, the user must press "Enter" without any text, and to set the value as empty, a sole whitespace must be inputted. 

Usage: `discovery config [subcommand] [flags]`

Flags:
`-h, --help`::
(Optional, bool) Prints the usage of the command.

`-p, --profile`::
(Optional, string) Set the configuration profile that will execute the command.

Examples:

```bash
# Ask the user for the configuration of profile "cn".
discovery -p cn config
Editing profile "cn". Press Enter to keep the value shown, type a single space to set empty.
